Ques : 

What is different between Docker & non-docker?

2 types 

Eshop 
	Catalog API
		docker run -p 8090:80 catalogapi:latest
	IndentityAPI
		docker run -p 8091:80 identityapi:latest
	BasketAPI
		docker run -p 8092:80 basketapi:latest
	OrderAPI
		docker run -p 8093:80 orderapi:latest

Docker-compose	
	-YAML
	- Run multiple containers together
===============================================================================
What is Orchestrator?
Orchtrator 
	- It is tool/software used to manage and monitor the clustered.
	- It performance automatic patching , scaling, re-deploy, backup, security etc.	
	- Docker cluster Orchestrastors
		- Kubernetes 
		- DC/ OS
		- DockerSwarn
	-Non-Docker cluster Orchestrator
		- Azure Service Fabric

Ques : 

What is different between Docker & non-docker?

	2 Types of clsuter
		1. Kunernetes (Docker or container cluster)
			- Orchestrator - Kubernetes
			- Used for deploying containerized applications
				-Containerized applications can monolithic or microservice (means it is containrized using Docker)
			- There will be a master node and more than one worker nodes
				-Master-worker architecture
				- Master node contains the orchestrator service and cluster management service (Name service, Failure Service, Storage Service which are running from master node.) 
			- 
				
		
		2. Service Fabric cluster (microservice)
			-Orchestrator - SF
			- It can deploy only microservice applications not monolithic apps
				- It can deploy containerized and non containerized apps
				It can deploy applications which is developed using SF SDK.
			- There is no master node, it used only worker nodes
				-Every worker noes is also master node.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Azure Kubernetes Service?
- It is a managed clustered and master node is managed by azure iyself.

-2 Container clusters 

	1.  AKS is a managed Kubernetes cluster (introduced 2 years back)
		It supports only Kubernetes
			They removed others as they support Linux (Container Service (deprecated))
	2. ACS (old service, now deprecated) is an examplr for unmanaged Kubernetes cluster
		- ACS provides option for selecting Orchestrstor type. such as (Kubernetes, DockerSwarn, DC/OS) 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Node 
	Is it a machine

Pod 
	-it is container of container
Scheduler
	Creating a containers in the node (worker machines)
Desired State

Scale up 
	Adding containers
Scale out 
	Adding resources	
Replication Controller
	
Here every servcie we need load balancer.

Que : How to map Service and containers?
	- Every Pod has IP but IP may change, so use lable, as it will not change.
	- Lable can be more than 1.
	- If lable is wrong, then we will not get the output, request will go till service but not to container.
	- 
	eg: App=Event
		Ver = 2.0
