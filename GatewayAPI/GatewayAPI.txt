Azure API Management Gateway (API Gateway)

What?
Why? 

Once application is deployed in server we can modify below things ( need re-dployment)
Challenges in API deployment
	- List of URL's (In Microservice we are creating new URL for all API's)
	- Security -> Have to implement for all API's 
	- Monitoring -> need to implement for all API's
	- Restriction (caching can not be implemented after deployment)
	- Request limiting/ Throthling -can  we implement in Azure Services? -> NO
	- Mocking of Services - Not already implemented, can we redeploy
	- Response confirmation/ transformation is not happening after deployment
		- Currently only json is the supoorted type but client want it in xml, that is not posible without code change and re-deployment
	- Set Header values/ Remove headers
- 

How to handle challenges-
	- We can use an intermediate component/ service called API gateway.
	- Every request for API 
	-

Architecture of gateway/ Components 
	1. Publisher Portal 
		-Azure Portal is now providing all functionality of Publisher portal
		- API publisher can configure the policies for operations, APIs and products
		-View all subscription requests and he can approve or cancel it.
	2. Developer Portal
		- Developer (Consumer of API) can send subscription request for accessing API
		- Once the publisher approves the request, developer will get a subscription key.
		-Subscription key need to be supplied with every request he makes to the API gateway
		Ocp-Apim-Sunscription-key
	3. Gateway
		- It is component that provides all features required for the API.
		- We will be implementing set of policies.
		- 	eg: How caching, request transformation is happeing
		- Different policies

			- Caching policy
			- Cors policy (security)
			- Mocking policy
			- Transformation policies
			- Set Header policy 
			- Jwt token validation policy (security)

===============================================

What is Product / API/ Operations

	- Product
		- Logical grouping of API (EShop)
			-API
				-CatalogAPI 
			- Operations
				- means API functions 
				- GetAll(), GetById()

Policies
-------------------------------

Caching 
	- Internal - InMemory cache
	- External 
	- Prefer-External - If external caching is avaialbel then will do external

Set Cors policy 


Where you can add/delete 
	In Outbound Procesing policies

Que: Can we use Gateway for our service? Yes
